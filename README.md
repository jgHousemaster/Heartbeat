# Heartbeat :heart:

## Introduction :bulb:

This is a simulation of heartbeat tactic. Designed and Created by team 3 for SWEN 755.

## To run the program :boom:
Run **src/HeartbeatReceiver** first, then run **src/HeartbeatSender**. Wrong order wouldn't work.

Observe the console of the **Receiver** which shows the heartbeat process clearly. When the sender crushes, the receiver would report that and pop up a warning window.
